Hi, this is my racing platformer created with python and tkinter.

To play, use the arrow keys to move, and space to jump
(if in multiplayer mode, player 2 uses wasd to move and g to jump)

press r to restart the game
press i at any point to reset your level

there are two powerups, jump boost and invincibility: both last 5 seconds
once you pick up a power up, it will be displayed in the top left corner, and you can't pick up another power up while 
already having a power up

if you manage to esacape the ghost enemies, and they no longer appear on the screen, they will be fully removed,
 (even if you scroll left) however, new enemies will spawn

if you manage to make it to a ladder, the ghosts will disappear, until you leave the ladder
